Backstory:
On this past spooky scary Halloween, lightning struck and you've been Twin Swapped with your SI Leader. Until we can figure this out, we'll need you to stand in for your SI Leader and get the show going!

Problem Statement:
Manage the upcoming SI Session for your SI Leader. Before an SI Session, a session plan must be made that includes an opener, a closer, and session content. An SI Leader may plan multiple activities
for their session content. For their session content, they need to write down the name of the activity and a description of the activity. Openers and closers are just idenitifed by name. They must also keep track
of the session date and time.

During the SI Session, an SI Leader must keep track of total attendance and students in attendance. Each student is identified by their RIT ID (abc1234) and their name, and SI Leaders are identified likewise. SI Leaders also have a number of semesters as an SI Leader associated with them.
A session is identified with a string that consists of the week number followed by 'A' if this is the first session of the week, and 'B' if this is the second session of the week.
